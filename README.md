# Hello there! 👋

I'm Ryan an inspiring software engineer with a passion for exploring the world, fueled by my love for coding, travel, and exciting hobbies. Let me tell you a bit about myself

## 👨‍💻😁 Computers

Software engineering is not just a profession for me – it's a passion. The ability to create almost anything with a computer is truly mind-blowing. Whether it's developing an RPG that takes place in space, where players battle space rabbits in epic encounters, or simulating the exploration of the unknowns of the ocean to find hidden treasures, the possibilities are boundless. This imaginative aspect of coding allows me to bring to life the wildest concepts and turn them into interactive and engaging experiences. It's the fusion of creativity and technology that makes working with computers an endlessly exciting and rewarding endeavor.

## 📚 Education

I am currently a sophomore enrolled in a CTE (Career and Technical Education) high school/secondary school, specializing in Cisco Networking. This immersive educational experience enables me to explore the nuances of networking technology, providing a solid foundation for my future pursuits in the field. This journey not only allows me to improve my collaborative skills but also grants me a deeper understanding of networking, offering knowledge that can give me a cutting edge in industries such as backend development, server-side game development, and many more.
